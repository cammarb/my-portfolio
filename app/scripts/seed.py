What I am loving most about Flask is it's simplicity. It is also really lightweight and because you basically start from scratch and install just the tools you could need. It's been quite easy to learn Flask, and I believe all this learned knowledge will make it even easier for me to learn Django, which is a more popular Python framework, and it's on the top ten of most in-demand technologies for web programming this year.",
